Reform
======

**Reform** aims to make traditional form frameworks a thing of the past by meeting some core goals and principles.
These simple rules allow both frontend and backend developers complete freedom and flexibilty when working with forms.

 1. Domain and view logic are completely separated
 2. Intuitive to use by both backend and frontend developers
 3. Clean, easy to follow code with no hidden "magic"

###Core concepts

 - Element    `Represent the parts of a form, from a simple text input to the form itself`
 - Decorator  `Provide element attachments, such as a label or description`
 - Validator  `Check the element value`
 - Filter     `Modify the element value before validation`
